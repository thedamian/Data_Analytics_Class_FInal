# My Final Project for the Boca Code Data Analytics Class

I had an incredible experience at the Boca Code's Data Analytics class.<br>
I am a developer manager, but I found that we didn't need any experience as a programmer and saw plenty of people excel at the course without any of the experience I brought to the table<br>

The final project I did was something I've always wanted to look into and with all the amazing information that Todd (the main teacher at Boca Code) brought to the table I was able to finally get that amazing knowledge I've wanted to have.

I quickly passed this information to my dad which also has the passion for looking at data and wanted to find out more of the story it tells.

Over all the Data Analytics course at Boca Code taught me some invaluable information I can use in my day to day job as a manager and also to play with and look at information that just looked like random bits of information and find out amazing facts. 

The numbers don't lie, and this class show that the class didn't lie and I have all the numbers I want.
